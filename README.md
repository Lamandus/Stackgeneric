# Stackgeneric

Dried stack and generic fruit/berries for BN


# Description

This mods get rid of all the stacks of different veggies/fruits etc. and put them in one pile. It unifies the calories to a somewhat average, same with vitamins. Due to the "unrealistic" nature, this is an optional mod


Also all fruits and berries are now just one item. Apple, pear, cherry, etc. are now just called "fruit". Blackberries, strawberries, etc. are now called berries. They stack as items normaly do and they have rounded stats.
